# Code scripts

This directory should contain only the code needed to produce the data and model
files needed for this project.

File names should be in snake case and start with a two-digit number showing the
order in which the files should be run to replicate the project from scratch.

Each file should be independent of any others, meaning packages should be loaded
at the start of each file and any exchange of data between packages should be
done via files stored in the `analysis_data/` directory.
